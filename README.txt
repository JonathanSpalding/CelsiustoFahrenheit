I added some CSS to my button so that:
1. The mouse turns to a pointer when hovering (Hot Tracking)
2. a blue border appears when hovering hovering (Hot Tracking)
3. When you click the button, it looks indented in like you clicked it
4. I would change it so that on mouseup	it changes the value, but that seems to be the default.
5. I found an image of the < and > to use rather than the actual character.

I added some Javascript to the error so that it disappears after 5 seconds.
